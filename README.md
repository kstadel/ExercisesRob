### running and testing code

to test and run the code in your file type open a new terminal 
in this vs code here and type in there 
node folder_name/exercise_name.js (path to the file that you want to execute)

the result should show up in the terminal now (ignore debugger)

### git commands

git pull (to get latest changes)

(to change the branch because main should always stay clean)
git checkout -b "branchname" 

git add .
git commit -m "your message telling what you have done"

git push 
(if the branch is not there yet you have to follow instructions in the terminal to initiate it)
