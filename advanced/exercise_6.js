// 1)
// sort the people according to their gender and store them in two arrays
// females: [{name: "Anna",gender: "Female"}...]
// males: [{name: "Bill",gender: "Male"}...]

// use nested for loop


// 2)
// copy paste and rewrite your nested for loop so that only 
// their names are in the arrays so that the outcome
// of your nested for-loop would be sth. like

// females: ["Anna", "Elaine"...]
// males: ["Tom", "Bill"...]
